# Contribution Guide
##### Version control
Use [Gitlab Flow](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html). 
Basically means, develop on branch features (feature/1-some-title) and then 
merge back to _master_.

##### Commits
See the concise post from [tpope](www.tpope.net) about [commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
